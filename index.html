<h2>My Experience</h2>
 Learning with Alt School has been quite fascinating and challenging so far, having to deal with creating forms with HTML, and using Git control version and Github for task submission.

 <h2>Programming Skills and Programming Languages</h2>
 Programming skills refer to the proficiency and expertise an individual has in using one or more programming languages to develop software and solve computational problems.
 Programming skills encompass the ability to understand and use programming languages effectively, as well as problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, debugging, and software design capabilities.<br>
 <br>
 Programming Language is a formal system with a set of rules and syntax used for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks.
 Programming languages are tools that provide a way for humans to communicate instructions to computers. They have syntax and semantics that determine how code is written and executed.
 Examples: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, Ruby. <br>
<br>
Some common types of Programming Languages includes; High-Level, Low-level, Compiled, Machine learning, Assembly, Query Languages e.t.c.<br>

      <td>High-Level Languages</td>
      <td>It is used for developing a wide range of applications, including desktop applications, web applications, mobile apps, and more. <br> They are commonly used for database interaction, making it easier to connect, query, and manipulate data stored in databases.</td>
      <td>1950-1985</td>
      <td>High-level languages typically provide built-in mechanisms for handling exceptions, making it easier to manage errors and unexpected situations.<br>High-level languages often provide interactive environments or interpreters, allowing programmers to test code snippets and experiment with algorithms more interactively.</td>

        <td> is commonly used for system programming tasks, such as writing operating system kernels, where direct control over hardware resources is essential.<br> is used to write the low-level boot code that initializes the computer system and loads the operating system into memory during the boot process.</td>
        <td>1947-1964</td>
        <td> It allows direct access to hardware resources, such as registers and memory addresses, providing fine-grained control over the computer's architecture.<br> It allows programmers to control memory directly, facilitating efficient memory management. This includes allocating and deallocating memory and working with pointers.</td>
